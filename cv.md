## Brief information about me

The main purpose of my appeal to the development of the frontend is to gain
sufficient independence from a specific place of work (a specific office, city
or country), as well as the opportunity to use creative potential.

The priority is the opportunity to develop creatively and technologically by
observing previously unfamiliar places outside the window.

I have quite a lot of life experience for my age. I earned my first money as a
breaking coach. I performed with the dance team at various events, festivals and
corporate events; and also participated in their organization. Now I sometimes
dance for myself and often play basketball. Then I worked for two years as a
logistician in the emergency service. At the same time, I learned how to write
and create music using computer programs. Then he worked in sales for 9 months,
gained confident skills in this field. I have been working as an smm manager for
six months now. I have been studying frontend for about two years now, and I
plan to look for a job soon.

My eyes are burning when I apply the new experience and new knowledge I have
gained. I want to develop in development in order to create beautiful and
effective interfaces.
